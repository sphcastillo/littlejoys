1. Product Catalog
   Frontend (React): Show product listings with filters (e.g. occasion, color, price).
   Backend (Python):

Store flower data (name, price, image URL, description) in a database.

Use Django ORM or Flask with SQLAlchemy to query the database.

Create RESTful APIs to fetch product listings: GET /api/products

2. Shopping Cart & Checkout
   Frontend: Add to cart, show current cart, checkout page.
   Backend:

Create endpoints for adding/removing items from the cart.

Handle checkout logic.

(Optional) Store temporary carts in session or Redis.

Python can generate order confirmation numbers and process order logic.

3. Order System
   Frontend: User can view past orders, order status (e.g. "Preparing", "Shipped").
   Backend:

Store orders in the database.

Endpoints like POST /api/orders, GET /api/orders/:id

Send confirmation emails (using Python's smtplib or a library like SendGrid)

4. User Accounts
   Frontend: Sign-up, login, profile page.
   Backend:

Use Django's built-in auth system or Flask-JWT for handling users.

Implement password hashing and JWT-based auth.

Save user preferences (favorite flowers, saved addresses).

5. Delivery Scheduling
   Frontend: Allow users to pick a delivery date and time.
   Backend:

Validate delivery time slots.

Integrate a calendar or time-slot scheduler in Python.

Store and manage delivery queues.

6. Search & Filters
   Frontend: Search bar with filters.
   Backend:

Python can process and return results from full-text search using Postgres tsvector, Elasticsearch, or simple filters.

Support query parameters: GET /api/products?category=roses&color=red

7. Admin Dashboard
   Frontend: Admin login, dashboard with inventory and order control.
   Backend:

Protected admin routes.

CRUD endpoints for managing flowers, inventory, pricing, and orders.

Dashboard analytics (top-selling flowers, weekly orders).

8. Recommendation System (Optional/Fun with Python)
   Use Python to build a simple recommendation engine (e.g. "customers who bought this also bought...")

Implement ML or rules-based logic using pandas and scikit-learn.

9. Email Notifications
   Python can send order confirmations, delivery updates, and promotional emails using smtplib, Flask-Mail, or third-party services.

10. Payment Integration
    Use Stripe or PayPal SDKs (they have Python libraries) to handle secure payments.
